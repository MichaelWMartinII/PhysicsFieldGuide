      <h1>Lagrangian Mechanics</h1>
      <p className="subtitle">
        Instead of forces, Lagrangian mechanics asks: what path minimizes the action?
        This single variational principle contains all of classical mechanics — and
        generalizes naturally to quantum fields and general relativity.

      <h2>L.1 Generalized Coordinates</h2>

      <p>
        The power of Lagrangian mechanics lies in the freedom to choose any coordinates that
        describe the system&apos;s configuration — not just Cartesian x, y, z. These are
        <strong>generalized coordinates</strong> qᵢ: angles, arc lengths, normal mode amplitudes,
        whatever parametrizes the space of possible configurations.
      </p>

      <p>
        A system with N particles in 3D has 3N degrees of freedom. Constraints (a bead on a wire,
        a pendulum on a rod) reduce this number. The number of independent generalized coordinates
        equals the number of degrees of freedom after constraints are imposed.
      </p>

      <Definition number="L.1" title="The Lagrangian">
        The Lagrangian L of a mechanical system is the difference between kinetic energy T
        and potential energy V:
        <span style={{ display: 'block', textAlign: 'center', marginTop: '0.5rem', fontStyle: 'italic' }}>
          L(q, q̇, t) = T − V
        </span>
        where q = (q₁, q₂, …) are the generalized coordinates and q̇ = dq/dt their time derivatives.
      </Definition>

      <h2>L.2 The Euler-Lagrange Equation</h2>

      <p>
        The <strong>principle of stationary action</strong> (Hamilton&apos;s principle) states that the
        actual path taken by a system between two configurations is the one for which the action
        S = ∫L dt is stationary (first variation vanishes). Applying variational calculus yields:

        Emmy Noether was not permitted to enroll at the University of Erlangen as a student — she could only audit lectures. She eventually earned a doctorate and joined the faculty
        at Göttingen, but without pay, listed officially as an assistant to David Hilbert. Her 1918 theorem connecting every symmetry of a physical system to a conserved quantity is one
        of the most beautiful results in all of physics. When Hitler's government dismissed Jewish professors in 1933, she lost her position. She moved to Bryn Mawr and died at fifty-three.
        Einstein called her the most significant creative mathematical genius yet produced.

      <p>
        This is one equation per degree of freedom. Remarkably, it automatically handles
        constraints — there is no need to compute constraint forces. The equation is also
        <strong>covariant</strong>: it takes the same form in any coordinate system.

      <h2>L.3 Conserved Quantities and Noether's Theorem</h2>

      <p>
        If the Lagrangian does not depend explicitly on a coordinate qᵢ (a <strong>cyclic coordinate</strong>),
        then the Euler-Lagrange equation gives d/dt(∂L/∂q̇ᵢ) = 0 — the conjugate momentum
        pᵢ = ∂L/∂q̇ᵢ is conserved.
      </p>

      <Theorem number="L.1" title="Noether's Theorem (1918)">
        For every continuous symmetry of the action, there is a corresponding conserved quantity:
        <span style={{ display: 'block', marginTop: '0.5rem' }}>
          Time translation symmetry &nbsp;→&nbsp; conservation of energy (Hamiltonian H)
        </span>
        <span style={{ display: 'block' }}>
          Spatial translation symmetry &nbsp;→&nbsp; conservation of linear momentum
        </span>
        <span style={{ display: 'block' }}>
          Rotational symmetry &nbsp;→&nbsp; conservation of angular momentum
        </span>
        This is the deepest explanation of conservation laws in physics — they are not axioms
        but consequences of the symmetry structure of nature.
      </Theorem>

      <p>
        The Hamiltonian H = Σ(pᵢq̇ᵢ) − L equals the total energy for natural systems (no
        explicit time dependence, no velocity-dependent potentials). The Hamiltonian formulation
        replaces 2nd-order ODEs in q with 1st-order Hamilton&apos;s equations in phase space (q,p):
        q̇ = ∂H/∂p, ṗ = −∂H/∂q.
      </p>

      <WorkedExample number="L.3" title="Central Force — Angular Momentum Conservation">
        <p>
          A particle moves under a central force V(r) only. Use polar coordinates (r, φ).
          Show that angular momentum is conserved.

        <Step label="T in polar:">T = ½m(ṙ² + r²φ̇²)</Step>
        <Step label="L:">L = ½m(ṙ² + r²φ̇²) − V(r)</Step>
        <Step label="φ is cyclic:">∂L/∂φ = 0 → d/dt(∂L/∂φ̇) = 0 → d/dt(mr²φ̇) = 0</Step>

          <li><strong>Generalized coordinates are not necessarily distances:</strong> angles, mode amplitudes, and constraints can all serve as coordinates.</li>
          <li><strong>The Lagrangian is not usually energy:</strong> L = T − V, while total mechanical energy is T + V for natural systems.</li>
