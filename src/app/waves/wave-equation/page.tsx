      <h1>The Wave Equation</h1>
      <p className="subtitle">
        The wave equation is the PDE that governs sound, light, vibrating strings, water waves,
        and quantum probability amplitudes. Its solutions — d&apos;Alembert&apos;s formula, standing waves,
        and dispersive packets — appear across all of physics.

      <h2>WE.1 Derivation from a Vibrating String</h2>

      <p>
        Consider a taut string with tension T and linear mass density μ. For small transverse
        displacements y(x, t), Newton&apos;s second law applied to a small element gives:
      </p>

      <EqNumbered number="WE.1" latex="\frac{\partial^2y}{\partial t^2}=v^2\frac{\partial^2y}{\partial x^2} \qquad v=\sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}} \qquad \text{(1D wave equation)}" />

      <p>
        This is the canonical form of the wave equation with wave speed v. The same equation
        governs longitudinal sound waves (v = √(B/ρ), B = bulk modulus), EM waves
        (v = 1/√(με)), and quantum mechanical free particles (v → operator, giving Schrödinger).
      </p>

      <h2>WE.2 D&apos;Alembert&apos;s Solution</h2>

      <Theorem number="WE.1" title="D'Alembert's Formula (1747)">
        The general solution to the 1D wave equation with initial conditions y(x,0) = f(x)
        and ∂y/∂t(x,0) = g(x) is:
        <span style={{ display: 'block', textAlign: 'center', marginTop: '0.5rem', fontStyle: 'italic' }}>
          y(x, t) = ½[f(x−vt) + f(x+vt)] + (1/2v) ∫(x−vt to x+vt) g(s) ds
        </span>
        The first term is the superposition of two copies of the initial shape — one traveling
        right at speed v, one left at speed v. Every solution is a sum of rightward and
        leftward traveling waves.
      </Theorem>

      <WorkedExample number="WE.1" title="Plucked String">
        <p>
          A string of length L is plucked at its center to height h and released from rest
          (g = 0). Describe the subsequent motion.
        </p>
        <Step label="Initial shape:">f(x) = triangular peak: 2hx/L for 0 ≤ x ≤ L/2, then 2h(L−x)/L for L/2 ≤ x ≤ L.</Step>
        <Step label="D'Alembert:">y(x,t) = ½[f(x−vt) + f(x+vt)], extended as odd periodic function.</Step>
        <Step label="Motion:">The triangle splits into two half-height triangles that travel in opposite directions. They bounce off the fixed ends (boundary condition y=0 there) and invert. The pattern repeats with period T = 2L/v.</Step>
        <Step label="Fourier view:">The triangular shape has Fourier series with only odd harmonics. Each harmonic has frequency nv/(2L) — the harmonics of a guitar string. The n=1 mode (fundamental) has frequency f₁ = v/(2L) = √(T/μ)/(2L).</Step>
      </WorkedExample>

      <h2>WE.3 Separation of Variables and Normal Modes</h2>

      <p>
        For a string fixed at x=0 and x=L, try y(x,t) = X(x)T(t). Substituting:
      </p>

      <EqNumbered number="WE.2" latex="\frac{\ddot T}{T}=v^2\frac{X''}{X}=-\omega^2 \qquad \text{(separation constant)}" />

      <p>
        The spatial equation X&apos;&apos; + (ω/v)²X = 0 with boundary conditions X(0)=X(L)=0 gives:
      </p>

      <EqNumbered number="WE.3" latex="X_n(x)=\sin\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right) \qquad \omega_n=\frac{n\pi v}{L} \qquad n=1,2,3,\ldots" />

      <p>
        These are the <strong>normal modes</strong> (standing waves). The general solution is a
        superposition:
      </p>

      <EqNumbered number="WE.4" latex="y(x,t)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\sin\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right)\left[A_n\cos(\omega_nt)+B_n\sin(\omega_nt)\right]" />

      <p>
        The coefficients Aₙ and Bₙ are determined by the initial conditions via Fourier
        sine series — Aₙ = (2/L)∫(0 to L) f(x) sin(nπx/L) dx.
      </p>

      <h2>WE.4 Dispersion Relations</h2>

      <Definition number="WE.1" title="Dispersion Relation">
        The <strong>dispersion relation</strong> ω(k) relates angular frequency ω to wavenumber k
        for waves in a medium. For the standard wave equation: ω = vk (linear, non-dispersive).
        Two velocities characterize dispersive waves:
        <span style={{ display: 'block', marginTop: '0.5rem' }}>
          <strong>Phase velocity:</strong> vₚ = ω/k — speed of a single-frequency wave crest.
        </span>
        <span style={{ display: 'block' }}>
          <strong>Group velocity:</strong> v_g = dω/dk — speed of a wave packet (carries energy and information).
        </span>
        When vₚ ≠ v_g, the medium is <strong>dispersive</strong>: different frequencies travel at
        different speeds, and pulses spread out over time.
      </Definition>

      <p>
        Examples of dispersion relations:
      </p>

      <EqNumbered number="WE.5" latex="\omega^2=v^2k^2+\omega_p^2 \qquad \text{(plasma, where }\omega_p\text{ is the plasma frequency)}" />

      <EqNumbered number="WE.6" latex="\omega^2=gk+\frac{\gamma k^3}{\rho} \qquad \text{(deep water: gravity + surface tension)}" />

      <EqNumbered number="WE.7" latex="\omega=\frac{\hbar k^2}{2m} \qquad \text{(non-relativistic de Broglie waves)}" />

      <WorkedExample number="WE.2" title="Group Velocity of a Wave Packet">
        <p>
          Two cosine waves with nearly equal frequencies: k₁ = k−δk, k₂ = k+δk,
          ω₁ = ω−δω, ω₂ = ω+δω. Find the envelope velocity.
        </p>
        <Step label="Superpose:">y = cos(k₁x − ω₁t) + cos(k₂x − ω₂t)</Step>
        <Step label="Sum-to-product:">= 2 cos((k₁−k₂)x/2 − (ω₁−ω₂)t/2) · cos((k₁+k₂)x/2 − (ω₁+ω₂)t/2)</Step>
        <Step label="Result:">= 2 cos(δk · x − δω · t) · cos(kx − ωt)</Step>
        <Step label="Interpretation:">Fast oscillation at (k, ω) — the carrier wave. Slow envelope at (δk, δω) — the beat. The envelope travels at v_envelope = δω/δk → dω/dk in the limit.</Step>
        <Step label="Conclusion:">v_group = dω/dk — the group velocity carries the packet and, in QM, the probability density.</Step>
      </WorkedExample>

      <h2>WE.5 Energy and Power in Waves</h2>

      <p>
        For a traveling wave on a string y = A sin(kx − ωt), the power transmitted past any
        point is:
      </p>

      <EqNumbered number="WE.8" latex="P=\frac{1}{2}\mu\omega^2A^2v=\frac{1}{2}TkA^2\omega" />

      <p>
        More usefully: P = ½μvω²A². The energy per wavelength is E_λ = P · (λ/v) = ½μωA² · λ.
        The energy density (energy per unit length) is u = ½μω²A² — equally divided between
        kinetic (½μẏ²) and potential (½T(∂y/∂x)²) at each instant, averaged over time.
      </p>

      <Definition number="WE.2" title="Common Traps">
        <ul style={{ marginTop: '0.4rem' }}>
          <li><strong>Boundary conditions choose the modes:</strong> the PDE alone does not decide whether sine, cosine, or mixed modes appear.</li>
          <li><strong>Phase velocity is not always signal speed:</strong> in dispersive media, energy and information travel with group velocity.</li>
          <li><strong>Fourier coefficients are set by initial conditions:</strong> normal modes are the basis, not the full answer by themselves.</li>
          <li><strong>Average power is cycle-averaged:</strong> instantaneous energy density oscillates between kinetic and potential forms.</li>

          solution={<>Gaussian pulse y(x,0) = exp(−x²/2σ²) in dispersive medium ω = ck + αk³ (cubic dispersion). At t=0: FT is Ŷ(k) = σ√(2π) exp(−k²σ²/2). At time t: Ŷ(k,t) = σ√(2π) exp(−k²σ²/2) exp(−iωt) = exp(−k²σ²/2) exp(−i(ckt + αk³t)). The linear term ck gives group delay (packet moves at c). The cubic term αk³t gives phase shift ∝ k³ — different frequencies arrive at slightly different times, spreading the pulse. Width grows: σ_eff ≈ √(σ² + (3α t/σ)²). In optical fibers: group velocity dispersion (GVD) is characterized by β₂ = d²k/dω² in ps²/km — a 1ps pulse in standard fiber spreads ~10× in 1km.</>}>
